###  I did not do everything alone in this project. My part was to complete the implementation of:
- **register** in such a way that it allows a user to register for an account via a form.
- **quote** in such a way that it allows a user to look up a stock’s current price.
- **buy** in such a way that it enables a user to buy stocks.
- **index** in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing, for the user currently logged in, which stocks the user owns, the numbers of shares owned,
 the current price of each stock, and the total value of each holding (i.e., shares times price). Also display the user’s current cash balance along with a grand total
 (i.e., stocks’ total value plus cash).
 - **sell** in such a way that it enables a user to sell shares of a stock (that he or she owns).
 - **history** in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing all of a user’s transactions ever, listing row by row each and every buy and every sell.
 - **personal touch** to allow users to add additional cash to their account.
 - Create one or more tables using sqlite if needed.
